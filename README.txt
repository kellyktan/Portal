This is my version of Valve’s game, Portal.

I didn’t use any third-party libraries or code.  I learned how to add audio from http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/java-play-audio.  

I started with a broken/sketchy version of this game that I had made for my APCS class in high school, but I changed the implementation of basically everything (how levels are written, how data is stored, how it responds to key presses and mouse clicks, etc.) and added better graphics and movement, status bar, reset button, instruction button, audio, etc.
